# Things to steal from Clojure

## Numbers
Arithmetic: inc dec
Test: even odd

## Strings # postpone all
Use: join ujoin
Regex: re_find re_ifindall re_finddict re_finddicts re_ifinddicts
       match_groups
# Should I insect them into re?
#     re.find re.ifindall ...
#
# Should I implement findict in re_find if there is groups?
# Or provide alternative versions?
#     re_first re_all re_iter

## Collections
Generic ops: empty not_empty into conj? (add?) merge(unite?) walk walk_keys walk_values
             # walk + filter
             select select_keys select_values # subdict ? postpone?
Content tests: is_distinct all any some none not-all?
# Capabilities and type tests - postpone

Set: sorted-set sorted-set-by
Lists: first second rest (or in seqs?)
Dict: flip walk_keys walk_values project(subdict) (dict_slice?) items,p iteritems groupby(to seqs?)
      sorted_dict sorted_dict_by join merge join_with,p merge_with,p
